# Shortest-Pathfinder-
🧠 AI Pathfinding Visualizer
A highly interactive and visually rich pathfinding visualizer using Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*, complete with animated robot traversal, performance stats, and theme switching.


🚀 Features

🎯 Algorithms: Dijkstra’s Algorithm & A* Search

🤖 Smooth Robot Animation: Character glides through the shortest path

🖱️ Intuitive Controls: Click to place/remove start, end, and barriers

🌌 Theme Toggle: Light & dark modes

🔢 Performance Stats: Shows time taken, steps, visited nodes, and cost

🎲 Random Obstacles: Quickly test algorithms with random layouts

🧱 Maze Generation: Auto-generate challenging grids (optional feature ready)

🎮 Real-time Feedback: Grid updates live with every interaction <br/> <br/><hr/>
